## Making Changes

### Coding Standards

- Follow Rust naming conventions
- Run `cargo fmt` before committing
- Run `cargo clippy` to check for issues
- Add tests for new functionality
- Update documentation as needed

### Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test

# Run with output
cargo test -- --nocapture

# Run specific test
cargo test test_name
```

### Building for Multiple Platforms

```bash
# Setup cross-compilation targets
make setup

# Build for all platforms
make release-all

# Or use cross directly
cross build --release --target x86_64-unknown-linux-musl
```
